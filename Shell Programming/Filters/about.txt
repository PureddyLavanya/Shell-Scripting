# ABOUT FILTERS IN UNIX 
Filters are programs that take plain text(either stored in a file or produced by another program) as standard input, 
transforms it into a meaningful format, and then returns it as standard output.
Here we discussed 3 types of filters.Those are:
1.grep(Global Regular Expression Print
2.sed(Stream Editor)
3.awk(abbreviated from the names of developers Aho,Weignberger and Kernighan)
